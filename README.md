<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. To construct a square wave with the help of fundamental frequency and its harmonic component

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Students will be able to learn the fundamental concepts of Fourier Series and understand the effect of the number of harmonics on the shape of the periodic square wave signal.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

This experiment demonstrates the application of the Fourier Series for the generation of a periodic signals. With this experiment, the student will be able to understand the concept of the Fourier series. This will also facilitate the student to analyze the mathematical expression of trigonometric Fourier Series in to the experiment.
